		<h4>What is Commander?</h4>
		<p>Also known as Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH), is a unique and
			social multiplayer variant of the game of Magic The Gathering. In
			Commander, each player constructs a deck consisting of 100 cards, led
			by a legendary creature designated as their "commander." Only one
			copy of each card (excluding basic lands) is allowed in the deck. The
			commander starts the game in the command zone and can be cast from
			there, but if it's sent to the graveyard or exiled, it can be recast
			for an additional cost. Players begin with 40 life, and games are
			typically played with four players. The format encourages creativity
			and personal expression in deck building, fostering a diverse and
			often unpredictable gaming experience. Additionally, there is a
			restricted list of cards that are banned or limited in Commander to
			maintain balance and enhance the overall enjoyment of the format.
			Commander emphasizes social interaction, multiplayer dynamics, and
			the joy of playing with iconic legendary creatures from Magic's vast
			history.
		</h4>
		<p>The Commander Battle Books stands as a companion for Magic The
			Gathering Commander aficionados, offering a web application to
			chronicle your epic battles. This platform allows players to document
			their Commander games, from deck names, color and, game outcomes.</p>
